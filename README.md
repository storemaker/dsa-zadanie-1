# C Memory managment

The memory is in your hands, that's why I have these functions:

## Malloc
Assigns memory using internal fragmenting to a char[] array.

## Free
Frees memory.

As mentioned above, I've used internal fragmenting so the blocks of memory are freed/allocated so as much as less space is wasted.
